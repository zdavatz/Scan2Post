## Use Case
The User's Browser with the Web-Application is open. The User inserts a card into the card reader. Scan2Post sends all the information from the card as a HTTP-Post request to the defined URL in a JSON File. The data is then processed by the API/Server and the Web-App can refresh with the Data that was sent via the HTTP-Post-Request.
